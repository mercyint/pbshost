MI Responsive Image & Video Lightbox
by Sarah Dudley |  Mercy Interactive, Inc.

The following will present a lightbox overlaying the entire page on pageload. It is responsive for all images as well as videos at 16:9. Images will not scale any larger than their original size, but will scale down to accommodate smaller screen sizes. For images, it is recommend that both a portrait and landscape orientations be provided, but not required.

The lightbox can contain:
- Static image with mobile alternative
- Vimeo video
- YouTube video

Responsive videos are set to 16:9 aspect ratio. Support for other dimensions can be added if demand exists.
It does not currently utilize cookies to limit the number of times the lightbox displays but can be updated if the need arises.
